# Linux-build-enironment-for-atmel-based-custom-boards
Build and flash environment for atmel based custom boards having on board programmer.

There are many custom boards using atmel series controllers having on board programmer,
they can be programmed in windows easly using HIDBootflash software. But for linux, BootloadHID 
utility is required, which needs to be build and using that atmel controllers can be flash.

## Insall necessay softwares
- sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude binutils 
- sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev

## Build bootloadHID utility:
- Get the bootloadHID source from the following repo: https://github.com/robertgzr/bootloadHID
- Extract and cd bootloadHID/
- cd commandline/
- make VENDORID=0x16c0 PRODUCTID=0x05DF

> The import details are the parameter for VENDORID and PRODUCTID, this determine which chip youâ€™re running. I think you might can extract this infromation from the datasheet of the chip. For me someone told me what parameter I have to use. Without this parameter, the compiler will produce wrong code that most likely not work on the chip.

The make command will create a the ./bootloadHID. This will be later used to flash.

## Build applicaion code:
- Now build you app source either using following commands or can use Makefile provided with this project
	- avr-gcc -g -Os -DF_CPU=12000000 -mmcu=atmega8 -c demo.c
	- avr-gcc -g -mmcu=atmega8 -o demo.elf demo.o
	- avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex demo.elf demo.hex

> Here, it is tested on atmel atmega8 mcu with frequency = 12Mhz. You can test it for other mcu's too.

## Flash application code:
Copy the bootloadHID bin created after that and paste it into your project folder.
	
If applicaion is build using above commands then use command:
- sudo ./bootloadHID demo.hex

If application is build using Makefile provided with this project then use command:
- make program
